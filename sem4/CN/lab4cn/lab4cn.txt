Introduction to packet tracer, creating of a lan amd connectivity test in the LAN creation of VLAN truncking

Theory:

Pacxket tracer:
Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern
 computer networks.The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.

Virtual LAN:
A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2).
 LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic.
The basic reason for splitting a network into VLANs is to reduce congestion on a large LAN. We also create VLAN for security purpose.


VLAN tracking:
VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that propagates the definition of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) 
on the whole local area network. To do this, VTP carries VLAN information to all the switches in a VTP domain. VTP advertisements can be sent over 802.1Q, 
and ISL trunks.


Create VLAN Database
click on swith and go to config we see VLAN database and add vlan number and vlan name
click on router and go to config we see VLAN database and add vlan number and vlan name

cli:
exit -> to exit
enable -> 
config t ->
