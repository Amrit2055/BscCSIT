GIL -> Global Interpreter Lock

~ is a mechanism used in computer-language interpreters to synchronize the execution of threads 
so that only one native thread can execute at a time.

~ is a mutual-exclusion lock held by a programming language interpreter thread to avoid sharing code that is not thread-safe with other threads

An interpreter that uses GIL always allows exactly one thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor.

EG: CPython , Ruby MRI
